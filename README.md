# Schema-As-Architecture

As database schema design is the foundation of system architecture, the goal of this repository is to demonstrate how business requirements can be translated into:

- Clear domain concepts
- Extracted nouns (entities)
- Explicit relationships
- Normalized relational schema
- Architectural thinking driven by data modeling

Instead of starting from controllers or APIs, this project starts from the core business model and builds the system structure from the database upward.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A learning exercise in domain-driven schema design
- A reference for thinking about architecture through data relationships

The main idea is simple:

If the schema is well-designed, the application architecture becomes clearer, more consistent, and easier to evolve.

This project reflects a system-design-first mindset, where structure precedes implementation.
